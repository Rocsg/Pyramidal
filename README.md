# Pyramidal


Pyramidal is a strategy 3d board game. The goal is to play each marble strategically to own the bigger part of the final play board. A marble af upper levels can be played as soon as the 4 underneath marbles are played. If you own 3 of these marbles, you automatically own the upper one as a bonus. 
This game was created by algorithmic curiosity, but you can easily have fun with it.

The current version let the player fighting against the AI. We can choose between "difficult" (player begins) or "very difficult" (AI begins)

AI is very strong, but it's just a baby ! The parameters are set intuitively. Next step should be to run machine learning to tune parameters, and set it unvincible !

Enjoy !
